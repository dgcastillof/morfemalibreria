## Project Overview

Morfema is currently a static website hosted on Firebase, designed to offer second-hand books for sale. The platform is simple, user-friendly, and organized as a public-facing catalog with updates managed manually.

While initially focused on book reselling, Morfema is gradually expanding. The long-term goal is to become a broader brand that promotes reading and writing through multiple services and sections: editorial content, creative writing workshops, literary reviews, and community initiatives.

All features should be developed with future scalability in mind, as the project is expected to evolve into a dynamic and interactive platform.
